# Introduction

WARNING: This guide is a work in progress and until a certain state this guide will be a chaotic mess with bunch of tips and missing sections. Come back later or use the available information to improve your skills.

If you ask someone "what is BDSM", you are likely to get a different answer depending on who you ask. This guide is not going to try to create a definition for each element in BDSM and for BDSM itself. You can call this "the advanced sex guide" as it will cover various tips and tricks for you to safely engage into more advanced and dangerous forms of sex.

The main goal of this guide is to properly inform the audience on how to participate into BDSM, it's risks and benefits.

# Concepts

The most common definition of BDSM is "bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, sadomasochism" or some variation of these words, but we believe this is definition is misleading. BDSM does not have to be about sadomasochism (gaining pleasure from causing physical pain to others), it can be, but does not have to be.

To make this guide a simple as possible, we suggest defining BDSM in scope of this guide as "consensual advanced arousing power exchange", we know that many in the BDSM community are going mad from reading such a definition, but please allow this definition to exist in the scope of this guide. To understand the meaning of this definition, consider the following explanation:
- Consensual: both partners need to agree to it
- Advanced: not for beginners
- Arousing: the activity gives you sexual arousal or even orgasm, but does not mean it has to be from sex
- Power exchange: a partner is submitting to another partner

In BDSM scene it is common to have a dominant (top/master/giver) and a submissive (bottom/slave/receiver), the dominant performs certain acts on the submissive and the submissive is allowing to receive physical or mental stimulation.

Note: There are also a concept called "switch", which is essentially a dominant or submissive that can change their role at any time.

Lets analyze how our definition works. The classical BDSM scene is when a dominant ties up a submissive and the dominant penetrating the submissive while the submissive is unable to resist. Here is what is obvious and not so obvious:
- The submissive has given up their power to resist to the dominant (power exchange)
- The penetration is causing both partners sexual arousal and pleasure
- The submissive has given consent prior the act that he/she allows the dominant to do to them certain activities with a set of limits and failsafe mechanisms
- The dominant follows submissive's given instructions and performs them on the submissive
- Being tied up is potentially dangerous making it not safe for beginners

You can have a lot more complex scenes with spanking and more bizarre activities, but the concepts listed above don't change very much, but it is a common misconception that a dominant violently abuses their submissive (though such an arrangement can exist too), but in reality the submissive has given consent and wanted the experience the specific stimulation. For example, if you ever had a desire to know how it feels when you are being spanked while wearing a dog collar and being called in names, but not being sexually penetrated, then you would rely this information to your dominant and give him/she consent to perform this on you, as specific as possible and you expect the dominant to follow your directions to the last bit.

In order to better understand more complex BDSM scenes, we suggest you to understand that the power exchange is going to be a very important key element of BDSM. The submissive gives up their power to their dominant.

Note: Sexual arousal can be very complex, but many people find the thought of no power very arousing when the scene is correct. Role playing is often important in BDSM scenes. Sex is not important in BDSM.

In BDSM consent is also very important, a person should not do anything that the other person did not consent to. The topic of "consent" is extremely complex, but we will try to simplify it for everyone to understand. Everything related to "consent" deserves a separate section.

Tip: No consent? No sex!

# Polyamory

It is quite common to see participants of BDSM to be into polyamory or the practice of having multiple romantic/sexual partners (the opposite of monogamy). This guide will not try to explain how to manage your polyamorous relationships, this is a complex topic that requires a LOT of research, trial&error on your own, but the purpose of this section is to explain a few key concepts that you should be aware.

Before you consider diving into polyamorous relationships, you must be warned. Polyamory is NOT for everyone.

WARNING: Never agree to polyamorous relationship if you are not into polyamory. Many people like to persuade others into polyamory, be warned that it can be very difficult for some people and has major drawbacks. Make sure you do your own research properly and understand the dynamics of polyamory.

While it may sound simple and easy, there are a few things you need to be aware that CAN happen in a polyamorous relationship:
- Partners can become jealous, not all people can deal with knowing that other people have sex with you
- Managing polyamorous relationships can be exhausting, consider it as a time management challenge
- Making sure your partner does not have any STIs can be difficult
- Friends and family might not understand your relationships

Before you jump to a conclusion about polyamory, you must understand that relationships are unique and each partner have their own set of arrangements. For example, there is no strict requirement of the frequency of sex or even having sex in the traditional sense at all. It is quite common in the BDSM scene for a "top" to have many "bottoms" that he/she does not have sex with, in return they have can have role play activities or other forms of activities. You can create all sorts of arrangements that work for you, but you need to find a partner that is going to benefit from these arrangements, otherwise your relationship might not work very well.

This guide will not try to persuade you into polyamory or monogamy. It is not for everyone, you need to ask yourself honestly what you want and what you are willing to put up with, but NEVER allow yourself to be forced into a relationship that you do not want. You will need to do an extensive research on this topic and maybe even write down all the pros and cons you can find, make sure you use as many information sources as possible, many of the sources that support polyamory or monogamy are going to be biased.

TIP: Seek for help from your friends or family if you are in a abusive relationship. Most don't want to judge you, they want to help you when you ask for help.

# Consent

Note: We are not going to try to define consent.

You might be thinking, what is so hard about consent, essentially just say "I consent" and all is good, but that has a few problems. To properly give consent using this approach you would have to script completely your BDSM scene, which would make you lose all the excitement that comes from not knowing what happens next (which is related to a quite common kink called "CNC").

A good example is "Consensual non-consent" or "CNC", but most commonly referred to "rape fantasy". In such a scene, a submissive gives consent to the dominant that they should act as a "rapist" and "rape" the submissive, but in reality everything is consensual, both are acting, but not actually hurting anyone. The problem here is that the submissive had a fantasy of being "raped", but was not very specific of what the dominant can and cannot do to them. To solve this problem we purpose to use a "sex menu".

The concept is simple, both partners sit down and talk, no BDSM scenes, no sexual arousal, just talking. The dominant hands the submissive a list of activities, some are related to sex, some are fetishes, some are unique activities that cannot be put into any category. The list has 3 columns "yes/no/maybe". Fill out the table together and talk about the activities. Respect the submissive's likes and dislikes. Add new entries to the table as you go along. For starters consider this table and try to fill it out with your partner (remove or add entries):


Bondage:
Rope
Mouth gag
Collars
Handcuffs
Blindfold
Earmuffs
Soft restraints
Metal restraints
Spreader bar

Note: It may be quite weird and repulsive to talk about some of these BDSM related activities. You should know your partner beforehand to curate the list for them and leaving out some activities that you know they do not like. This will not work very well on one night stands, BDSM in general does not work very well on one night stands.

Tip: Encourage your submissive to reveal their fantasies. You can use this information to make a better list, but never judge a person because of their fantasies.

When the "menu" is filled out, you should understand that "no" means "NO", period. "Yes" means "Yes, I would enjoy that, if the scene is right". "Maybe" means "I might enjoy it if the scene is right". The complex part is "if the scene is right". What your partner expects is that you lead up to the activity and have the proper context, warmup and technique. For example, most people will not enjoy a full strength spanking as soon as your scene starts, but they might enjoy it if you bring your partner to a high arousal state and increase the spanking intensity over time.

Note: Keep in mind that the "menu" can change over time. This is normal and expected. If you suspect that your partner's likes and dislikes have changed, it is better to ask about it before you engage into a BDSM scene.


# Fantasies

Before you go and tell everyone your sexual fantasies, bare in mind that some fantasies supposed to be fantasies and never be preformed in reality. Some of these fantasies can be extremely dangerous and simply stay a fantasy forever, which is fine. Fantasies can be very vivid, but you can also ask yourself honestly what is the aspect of your fantasy that is the most appealing.

What you should consider is that your fantasies can be imitated. For example, you might have a kink for double penetration, but you find polyamory unappealing, you can arrange with your partner a scene where the additional penis is replaced with a dildo and some role playing. With fantasies, your own ability to fantasize is the limit. You should not suppress your fantasies nor you should embrace them, you need to be rational and honest to yourself, but don't bash yourself for having fantasies.

Tip: Most likely your fantasy is common. Even a fantasy of being tied up to a town pole and being fed hormones to produce milk for the town folks is more common than you think.

When revealing your fantasies to your partner, you should explain that your fantasy is just a fantasy, it should not be taken seriously. Explain to your partner what you find arousing, get to know what they think and only then suggest that you might want to act out parts of this fantasy with him/her in the future. There is a risk that your partner is going to judge, try to reassure your partner if you suspect your partner might not fully understand your fantasies.

Some fantasies are hard to preform and requires quite a lot of creativity and work. For example, some people have a fantasy that they are being sexually used while they are sleeping. Such activity might require one partner to be fully woken up while the other partner to be warmed up for penetration and still sleeping, which is near impossible in the middle of the night. To fulfill this fantasy the dominant requires quite a lot of work and ingenious planning.
